# Azure DevOps Pipeline Setup

The pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`) builds frontend, reactions, and mood images, pushes them to **Docker Hub**, then deploys to **EC2 (Docker Compose)**, **Kubernetes (manifests)**, or **Kubernetes (Helm chart)** based on the parameter you choose.

- **Agent pool:** Default  
- **Image registry:** Docker Hub  
- **Parameters:** `deployTarget` (ec2-docker-compose | k8s | k8s-helm), optional `imageTag`

---

## 1. Variable group: ITGATE

All pipeline variables are taken from the **variable group** named **`ITGATE`**.

In Azure DevOps: **Pipelines → Library → Variable groups → Create variable group** (or use an existing one). Name it **`ITGATE`**, then add:

| Variable | Description | Secret |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | Your Docker Hub username (e.g. `myuser`). Images will be `myuser/Mina-chat-frontend`, etc. | No |
| `EC2_DEPLOY_PATH` | (EC2 only) Path on the EC2 server where to copy files and run compose (e.g. `/home/ubuntu/app`). | No |

The pipeline references this group with `variables: - group: ITGATE`. Ensure the pipeline has access to the group (Pipeline permissions in the group settings).

### Pipeline-computed variables (TAG and effectiveTag)

The pipeline also sets two variables **inside the YAML** (not in the variable group). They control which Docker image tag is built and deployed:

| Variable | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| **`TAG`** | `$[ coalesce(variables['Build.SourceVersion'], variables['Build.BuildId']) ]` — Uses the **commit SHA** (e.g. `a1b2c3d`) if available; otherwise falls back to the **build ID** (e.g. `12345`). Used as a default/fallback identifier. |
| **`effectiveTag`** | `$[ eq(coalesce('${{ parameters.imageTag }}', ''), '') ? variables['Build.BuildId'] : '${{ parameters.imageTag }}' ]` — This is the tag **actually used** for images and deployment: if you pass a **Docker image tag** when running the pipeline (e.g. `v1.0`), that value is used; otherwise the pipeline uses the **build ID** (e.g. `12345`). So: *parameter provided → use it; otherwise → use Build.BuildId*. |

So when you run the pipeline, images are tagged with `effectiveTag` (and often also `latest`). Deploy steps use `effectiveTag` so EC2 or K8s pull the same build you just pushed.

## 2. Service connections

### dockerHubConnection (required for build)

1. **Project Settings → Service connections → New service connection → Docker Registry**  
2. **Docker Hub**  
3. Name: **`dockerHubConnection`** (must match pipeline).  
4. Docker ID and password (or access token).  
5. Save.

### EC2 – SSH (required for EC2 deploy)

1. **New service connection → SSH**.  
2. Name: **`EC2-SSH`**.  
3. Host: your EC2 IP or hostname.  
4. Port: 22.  
5. Username: e.g. `ubuntu`.  
6. Private key: paste the private key (or use a variable).  
7. Save.

### orbstack-k8s (required for K8s deploy)

1. **New service connection → Kubernetes**.  
2. Name: **`orbstack-k8s`**.  
3. Server URL and kubeconfig (or Service account) so the agent can run `kubectl`.  
4. Save.

---

## 3. Environments (optional)

The pipeline uses environments **`ec2`** and **`k8s`** for deployment. If they don’t exist, Azure DevOps can create them on first run, or you can add them under **Pipelines → Environments** and optionally set approval checks.

---

## 4. Running the pipeline

1. **Run pipeline** and choose:
   - **Deployment target:** `ec2-docker-compose`, `k8s`, or `k8s-helm` (Helm chart to local cluster)
   - **Docker image tag:** leave empty to use build ID, or set e.g. `v1.0`
2. Build stage: builds and pushes three images to Docker Hub.  
3. Deploy stage: **ec2-docker-compose** — copies compose files to EC2 and runs `docker compose`; **k8s** — applies raw K8s manifests in order; **k8s-helm** — runs `helm upgrade --install` with the `helm/Mina-chat` chart (agent needs `kubectl` and the chart uses the same image tag).

---

## 5. EC2 prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed.  
- `EC2_DEPLOY_PATH` writable by the SSH user.  
- If using private registry: `docker login` on EC2 (or use the same Docker Hub credentials so `docker compose pull` works).

---

## 6. K8s prerequisites

- Cluster has an Ingress controller (e.g. NGINX) if you use the Ingress manifests.  
- **TLS cert and key for Ingress:** The pipeline creates the `ingress-tls` secret in the `frontend` and `backend` namespaces from secure files. In **Pipelines → Library → Secure files**, upload two files named exactly **`tls.crt`** and **`tls.key`** (e.g. from `k8s/ssl/` or your CA). Authorize the pipeline to use them.  
- Namespaces `frontend`, `backend`, `data` will be created by the manifests if not present.

---

## 7. Workaround: K8s agent and local clusters (OrbStack, minikube, Docker Desktop)

When the pipeline runs on an **agent** (e.g. a CentOS server) and the Kubernetes cluster runs on your **laptop or Mac** (OrbStack, minikube, Docker Desktop), the agent cannot reach the cluster by default.

### Why it fails

- The cluster’s API server usually listens only on **127.0.0.1** (localhost) on the machine where the cluster runs.
- The agent has a kubeconfig pointing at your machine’s LAN IP (e.g. `https://172.20.10.3:26443`). The network path is fine (ping works), but **nothing is listening** on that IP:port on your Mac—only on 127.0.0.1. So you get **connection refused**.
- Desktop K8s (OrbStack, minikube, Docker Desktop) typically do not bind the API server to a LAN IP for security.

### Workaround: SSH tunnel

Run an **SSH port forward** **on the agent** so that traffic to the agent’s localhost:26443 is sent over SSH to the cluster host’s 127.0.0.1:26443.

**1. On the agent machine** (e.g. CentOS where the pipeline runs), start the tunnel:

```bash
ssh -f -N -L 26443:127.0.0.1:26443 YOUR_USER@CLUSTER_HOST_IP
```

| Part | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `-f` | Run SSH in the background after connecting. |
| `-N` | No remote shell or command—only port forwarding. |
| `-L 26443:127.0.0.1:26443` | On the agent: listen on port **26443**; forward to the **remote** host at **127.0.0.1:26443** (where the API server actually listens). |
| `YOUR_USER@CLUSTER_HOST_IP` | SSH login to the machine that runs the cluster (e.g. `minajohn@172.20.10.3`). |

Use the **cluster host’s LAN IP** (the one the agent can ping). For OrbStack the API port is usually **26443**; for minikube/kubeadm it is often **6443**—adjust the port in `-L` and in kubeconfig if needed.

**2. Set the agent’s kubeconfig** so the cluster server is **localhost** on the agent:

- **server:** `https://127.0.0.1:26443`  
  (Do **not** use the cluster host’s LAN IP here; use 127.0.0.1 so `kubectl` talks to the tunnel.)

**3. Verify from the agent:**

```bash
kubectl get all
```

**4. Pipeline / service connection**

- The **orbstack-k8s** (or your K8s) service connection must use a kubeconfig that has **server: https://127.0.0.1:26443** and is valid **on the agent** (same user that runs the pipeline, or a shared config the agent reads). The tunnel must be **running** whenever the pipeline runs the K8s deploy job.
- If the pipeline runs as a different user (e.g. `azpagent`), either run the tunnel as that user (e.g. systemd user service) or start the tunnel in the pipeline before the Kubernetes steps (e.g. a step that runs the `ssh -f -N -L ...` command with the right SSH key).

### Summary

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | On the **agent**, run: `ssh -f -N -L 26443:127.0.0.1:26443 user@cluster-host-ip` |
| 2 | In the agent’s **kubeconfig**, set the cluster server to `https://127.0.0.1:26443`. |
| 3 | Ensure the tunnel is active when the pipeline runs (same user or started in the pipeline). |
